*No* is being developed as a more user friendly alternative to Go.

*(Note: This is a work in progress (pre-alpha).)*

Since Go compiler devs and rest of the Go community are unwilling to change the
syntax and semantics of Go to make it slightly more user-friendly, it seems
necessary for us to create a new language that builds upon their work, and makes
Go slightly better for our personal use.

Introducing No, a new language that will transpile to Go (and later to Go IR),
such that we can reuse libraries and frameworks developed by the talented Go
community.

While this new language is being created as a political statement against the
Draconian measures followed by Go devs (and community), it is important
for us to state that we love many things about Go, thus we wish to improve it.

However it is also necessary to accept that this project exists because Go devs
refuse to listen to the requests made by their users.

*(Note: This is a work in progress and will require some time for us to finish
development. So we thank everyone for your patience and support.)*
